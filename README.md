# Auto Accepting Queue's


## Idea:
### Accepts Queue When AFK (no cheating at all).

## Settings:
### There is a properties screen that is configurable for a few settings in the task tray icon:
### Check For Launch Page - Sets how often a timer will run to check if you are out of a game or if league of legends was launched again).
### Check for Queue Pop - Sets how often a timer will run while the league launcher is running (currently does not matter if you are in the queue or not).
### Show Application Vision - This allows for paint to open up at the queue time interval to make it easier to adjust the % at which the accept location will be at (70% from the top and 50% from the left are default).
### Allow Launcher to Minimize - This will force the league of legends client to never be minimized, the way this is written it will take a print screen and use OCR (Optic Character Recognition) to check a certain part of the screen if the queue has popped.
### Accept Location From Top - % at which the cursor will click when the queue pops start point top of client.
### Accept Location From Left- % at which the cursor will click when the queue pops start point left of client.
