# Settings:
## There is a properties screen that is configurable for a few settings in the task tray icon:
###**(Crop Start/Size) - This determines what the program can see**:
### Image Crop Start Top - % at which the image will start the cropping of the league client from the top.
### Image Crop Start Left- % at which the image will start the cropping of the league client from the left.
### Image Crop Start Width - % at which the image will shrink to from the sides.
### Image Crop Start Height - % at which the image will shrink to from the top/bottom.

###**(Accept Location) - This determines where the program will click**:
### Accept Location From Top - % at which the cursor will click when the queue pops start point top of client.
### Accept Location From Left- % at which the cursor will click when the queue pops start point left of client.


###**(Accept Settings) - This determines where/what the program does**:
### Check For Launch Page - Sets how often a timer will run to check if you are out of a game or if league of legends was launched again).
### Check for Queue Pop - Sets how often a timer will run while the league launcher is running (currently does not matter if you are in the queue or not).
### Show Application Vision - This allows for paint to open up at the queue time interval to make it easier to adjust the % at which the accept location will be at (70% from the top and 50% from the left are default).
### Allow Launcher to Minimize - This will force the league of legends client to never be minimized, the way this is written it will take a print screen and use OCR (Optic Character Recognition) to check a certain part of the screen if the queue has popped.
